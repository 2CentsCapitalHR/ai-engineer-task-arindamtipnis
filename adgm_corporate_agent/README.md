# ADGM-Compliant Corporate Agent

This project is an intelligent AI-powered legal assistant to help with ADGM business incorporation and compliance. It runs entirely locally using Ollama and a compatible open-source language model.

## Setup

1.  **Install Ollama:**
    -   Go to [https://ollama.com/](https://ollama.com/) and download the application for your operating system (macOS, Windows, or Linux).
    -   Run the installer.

2.  **Download a Language Model:**
    -   Open your terminal and run the following command to download the `llama3` model. This is the recommended model for this project.
    ```bash
    ollama pull llama3
    ```
    -   Ollama will automatically start running in the background.

3.  **Create a Python virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

4.  **Install dependencies:**
    -   First, upgrade pip to the latest version:
    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade pip
    ```
    -   Then, install the required packages from `requirements.txt`:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Ingest Legal Data:**
    -   Before running the application for the first time, you need to download the legal reference documents.
    ```bash
    python3 data_ingestion.py
    ```
    -   This will download all the required documents into the `data/` directory.

## How to Run

1.  **Ensure Ollama is Running:**
    -   The Ollama application should be running in the background. You can check this by seeing its icon in your system's menu bar or taskbar.

2.  **Start the Gradio application:**
    ```bash
    python3 app.py
    ```
    -   The first time you run this, it will take a few moments to initialize the RAG pipeline and create the embeddings. Subsequent runs will be faster.

3.  **Open your browser:**
    -   Navigate to the local URL provided by Gradio (usually `http://127.0.0.1:7860`).

4.  **Upload Documents:**
    -   Upload one or more `.docx` files for analysis.

5.  **Analyze:**
    -   Click the "Analyze Documents" button to start the process. The application will provide a JSON report and a downloadable, reviewed `.docx` file with comments.
